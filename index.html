                <h1>Etymology</h1>
                <p>
                    The name Vedi is derived from the Arabic word wadi (Arabic: وادي), meaning valley. It may have been
                    incorporated into Armenian through the Persian language. Vedi is also the name of the river by which
                    the town is located. The town has been occasionally known as Verin Vedi (Upper Vedi in Armenian). It
                    was officially renamed Vedi in 1946.

                    <h1>Culture</h1>
                    <p>
                        The house of culture in Vedi was opened in the 1930s. In 2013, a new building was built to house
                        the town's theatre and other cultural faculties. The house has its theatre group (founded in
                        1950), folk instruments' ensemble (1977), dance group, brass band, and children's orchestra.
                        During summers, the house of culture organizes the musical Thursdays of Vedi at the open-air
                        amphitheatre of the central park of the town.
                        The Paruyr Sevak Public Library of Vedi has been operating since 1935. It houses around 58,000
                        books. The town has also a school of music and a school of art.

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    Following the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828 and the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay between
                    Qajar Iran and the Russian Empire in 1828, Vedi became part of Imperial Russia. During the 1830s,
                    around 500 Armenians were allowed to move from the Persian city of Maku to Böyük Vedi. In 1849, the
                    settlement became part of the Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire.
                    During the second decade of the 20th century, Many Western Armenian families from the Ottoman cities
                    of Van, Shatakh and Mush migrated to Vedi, escaping the Armenian genocide.[4]
                    In 1918, Böyük Vedi became a separate gavar (administrative district) within the independent
                    republic of Armenia. During the period of the First Republic of Armenia (1918–1920), Böyük Vedi was
                    one of the main centres of Muslim rebellion against Armenia.[5] On 12 July 1920, the Armenian army
                    recaptured the settlement from local Turkic rebels.[6][5]
                    The symbol of Vedi at the northern entrance to the town, erected in 1986
                    Following the Sovietization of Armenia, Böyük Vedi became the part of the newly-formed Vedi raion in
                    1930. In 1946, the settlement was officially renamed Vedi. During the 1940s and 1950s, Armenian
                    population became majority in Vedi, through a new wave of resettled families from the areas of
                    Sisian, Yeghegnadzor and Martuni. In 1963, Vedi was given the status of an urban-type settlement. In
                    1968, the Vedi raion was renamed Ararat raion.
                    After the independence of Armenia, Vedi was given the status of a town as per the administrative
                    reforms of 1995.
